ÔªøSomeone must have slandered Josef K., for one morning, without having 
done anything wrong, he was arrested.

The cook, who always [31m<<broght>>[0m[0m him his breakfast at eight o‚Äôclock, did 
not come this time. That had never happened before. For a moment he 
lay still, looking at the pillow and the old woman who lived opposite
and who was watching him with an inquisitiveness quite unusual for 
her. Then, with [31m<<astonshment>>[0m[0m, he noticed that a man he had never seen
before was in his room. He was wearing a tight black suit which, 
with its various [31m<<trimings>>[0m[0m, looked like a travelling outfit that had
gone out of fashion years ago.

‚ÄúWhat do you want?‚Äù asked K., raising himself half up in bed.

ÔªøMany years later, as he faced the firing squad, Colonel [31m<<Aureliano>>[0m[0m Buend√≠a
was to remember that distant afternoon when his father took him to discover ice.

At that time Macondo was a [31m<<vilage>>[0m[0m of twenty adobe houses, built on the bank
of a river of clear water that ran along a bed of [31m<<pollished>>[0m[0m stones, which were
white and enormous, like prehistoric eggs. The world was so recent that many
things lacked names, and in order to indicate them it was [31m<<necesary>>[0m[0m to point.

Ôªø124 WAS SPITEFUL. Full of a [31m<<baby's>>[0m[0m venom. The women in the house knew 
it and so did the children. For years each put up with the spite in his 
own way, but by 1873 [31m<<Sethe>>[0m[0m and her daughter Denver were its only victims.
The grandmother, Baby [31m<<Suggs>>[0m[0m, was dead, and the sons, Howard and [31m<<Buglar>>[0m[0m, 
had run away by the time they were thirteen years old--as soon as merely
looking in a mirror shattered it (that was the signal for [31m<<Buglar>>[0m[0m); as soon
as two tiny hand prints appeared in the cake (that was it for Howard). Neither 
boy waited to see more; another kettleful of chickpeas smoking in a heap on 
the floor; soda crackers crumbled and strewn in a line next to the door sill.

ÔªøThis is a bunch of gibberish:

ansdka nakdlsnakln lnfgklanrf nksladnksal nkglrnkadf nklsadn

These are definitely misspelled, but probably don't have any suggestions.

ÔªøCall me Ishmael. Some years ago‚Äînever mind how long precisely‚Äîhaving little 
or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, 
I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world. 
It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation.

ÔªøIt was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen. 
Winston Smith, his chin nuzzled into his breast in an effort to escape the vile wind, 
slipped quickly through the glass doors of Victory Mansions, though not quickly 
enough to prevent a swirl of gritty dust from entering along with him.

ÔªøAll happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.

Everything was in confusion in the Oblonskys' house. The wife had discovered 
that the husband was carrying on an intrigue with a French girl who had been
a governess in their family, and she had announced to her husband that she
could not go on living in the same house with him.
